# Niyantri Cafe Website

A complete, production-ready set of pages for a coffee shop website built using Tailwind CSS utilities and category-appropriate typography.

Project scope:
- Pages: Home (index.html), About Us (about.html), Menu (menu.html), Checkout (checkout.html), Contact Us (contact.html)
- Design system aligned with Coffee Shop category: color palette, font pairings, and subtle animations using Tailwind classes
- Font system per category: Montserrat (headers) + Open Sans (body)
- Hero sections include background images with an overlay and accessible alt text
- Navigation links across all pages maintain consistent structure
- All images use descriptive alt attributes
- Phase 2: Fully generated site with internal linking and realistic content

How to run:
- Open the HTML files directly in a browser from the generated folder, or serve via any static server.
- No build steps required beyond loading the HTML files.

Notes:
- Background images are placeholders using the provided image syntax: https://images.pexels.com/photos/5877588/pexels-photo-5877588.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940. Replace with actual image URLs as needed.
- Fonts are loaded from Google Fonts to ensure typography matches the category guidelines.
- All styles are implemented via Tailwind utility classes (no external CSS files).
